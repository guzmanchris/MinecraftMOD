# Blocks
5 blocks are unique to this mod. 2 basic blocks (Twitter and Instagram blocks), 1 ore (Mango Wood Ore) and 2 with tile entities
(Power Generator and Pipes).

# Recipes
The mod adds three new recipies. The first one is for creating nine whistles(the item created in our phase 1). You make 
this recipe by putting one Twitter block in the middle. The second one is for creating a Twitter block, its done by placing 9 whistles. The last one is for making an Ocarina. This item is made by putting 6 lapiz lazuli blocks, 3 on the TOP and 3 on the BOTTOM, and 3 whistles in the CENTER. 

# Smelting
The Mango Wood ore created can be smelted into a whistle.

# Armor, Tools and Sword
All of the weapons and tools were forge thanks to the Mango ore(not related to the fruit).You can find everything Mango by typing Mango in the inventory search bar in-game. The color for this items is a light red almost pink.

# Power Generator and Power Transport Pipes
This mod implements a Power Generator and provides Pipes as a tool for Power Transfer. Each Generator has 10000 power
units by default. If you wish to add more power you can right click the block and place a burnable item in the generator.
Your Power Generator can send or receive power. By default, the generator is set to send power. You can set it to receive
power by pressing 'shift' and right clicking the block (Note: you must not be holding any item for this to work -- You must
use your bare hand). If you place pipes in between a generator set to send and another set to receive, the power is transfered
from one to the other. You can also check how much power is in the pipes by right clicking them.
